# ModalWindow
This is a demo game implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Beginner friendly project). I made this demo to learn JavaScript. #project2


It is an application in which you select one of the 6 buttons and a new window with different texts will open. Closing the window is done in 3 ways.
- click on "X"
- click on the container outside the window
- click on the "ESC" key
